## Scratch

Here is a brief description of scripts contained herein:

* bitmex_websockets.py -- script that run's on Charlie's laptop and reads quotes from bitmex and writes them to a local MySQL data store.

* bitmex_websockets_wrapper.py -- script that run's on Charlie's laptop and uses the (buggy) BitMEXWebsocket wrapper.

* gists.py -- useful Python snippets.

* bitmex_trading_bot_for_movements.py -- script that implements a *movement-driven* strategy from David.

* import-trade-buckets.py -- script that import trade-buckets from CVS (specifically from historical trade-buckets Tim downloaded).  Optionally, this script may be used to fill any gap in trade-buckets going back as far 21 days.

* From Tim:  bitmex-btc-price-1-minute-data.py is a script used to download trade-buckets to CSV. park_algo.py is work Tim did to test and create his long-trading model.  park_short_algo.py is work Tim did to test and create his short-trading model.
